Johann
======

Johann is a theorem-proving system that implements data-driven
automated-conjecturing by building and statistically analyzing
a large database of equtations in various extensions of combinatory algebra
(equivalently, lambda-calculus).
This repository includes

* C++ code to build combinatory databases.
  See the cpp/ directory.

* A collection of code-as-dissertation in a literate programming style ".jtext",
  which develops a lambda-calculus corpus for datamining.
  See the scripts/ directory

* A Python front end to latex for typesetting the literate programs
  ( __jtext2latex___ ).
  See the jtext/ directory.

* A C++ mapper to visualize johann databases.
  See the mapper/ directory.

* Some sketches of web-apps using Johann databases.
  See the html/ and cpp/ directories.

__WARNING__ As of 2011-11-01, most of the code is broken

EigenViz
--------

EigenViz is a little sub-project for visualizing sparse graphs
in 3D space + 3D color.
It is fast, simple, and based on OpenGL.
See the eigenvis/ directory for further information.
